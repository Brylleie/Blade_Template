Blade Templating in Laravel
Laravel's Blade is a templating engine that allows developers to create dynamic HTML pages using PHP code in a readable and efficient manner. Blade offers features like template inheritance, reusable components, and automatic escaping to prevent XSS attacks3. Blade files use the .blade.php extension and are stored in the resources/views directory.
